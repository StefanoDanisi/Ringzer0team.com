After downloading and unzipping the file, you are presented with a pdf and a JPEG. You need to find city where Dr. Pouse is being kept and who kidnapped him.

To Find the city where Dr. Pouce is you will need to look in the metadata of the JPEG file (EXIF data) where you will find latitude and longitude. 
You input those results into a online mapping service (https://www.gps-coordinates.net) and you will see the location is, "Halifax, NS, Canada".

To find out who the evil man is, you can open the pdf using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, right click inside the document which brings up a menu and then click on the tab that says, "Document Properties..." which will show who the author of the file is (Steve Finger).

The FLAG is: HalifaxSteveFinger
